Point Nine Repeated
 _
.9 = 1

Point nine repeated equals one.
I know that this is true,
because I was convinced.
Not because I keep the proof.
I would have to reference the Internets to suit your incredulity.
Unless you already knew.
Believe me or not, there is no arguing.
Because I was convinced, one time.
Now, what I want to know is.
Why can't I remember why?

I can prove I don't grok why, if needed:
If I did then there would have to be
something special about point n repeated,
Where n is only limited by my imagination.
Put that in the math canon, and shoot!

So then why can't I imagine the fact that is true?
Because it never burned my skin?
Because it never poked me my good the eye?
OH! But I can imagine ALL of the nines!
I can imagine a conga line of nines!
One after the next, fore to tail, 
dancing in one infinite loop.
And scatter bout the barn here and there
One niner, plus one n of nines, 
where n makes it a group.
A few more nines keep time
One with a banjo
One whistling, one stomping boot
One with, what is that, a pipe or a flute?
One with one tooth.
That one in the corner is actially two, 
one of whom is roughing his suit.
And some ones mirror loved ones, in the photo booth.
All of sudden one nine hollars, 
"Hey all you decimals, point to your right."
Which is left to us.

Well, scratch my imagination. 
Poof. All is one.
