Point Nine Repeated
or, It's not just lot of 99th percentiles.
 _    __
.9 = .99 = 1

I know that this is true
because I have been convinced.
Not because I have the proof.
I would have to reference the Internets to suit your incredulity.
Unless you already knew.
Believe me or not, there is no arguing.
Because I have been convinced, more than one time.
Now, what I want to know is.
Why can't I remember why?

I can prove I don't grok why, if needed:
If I did then there would have to be
something special about point n repeated,
Where n is only limited by my imagination.
Put that in the math canon, and shoot!

So then wh can't I imagine the fact that is true?
Because it neve burned my skin?
Because it never poked me in the eye?
OH! I can imagine all of the nines!
I can imagine a conga line of nines!
One after the next, fore to tail, one infinite loop.
And scatter bout the room here and there
One nine, plus one n, where n makes it a group.
A few more nines keep time
One with a banjo
One whistling, one stomping boot
One with, what is that, a pipe or a flute?
One with one tooth.
That one in the corner is actially two, 
one of whom is roughing his suit.
And some ones mirror loved ones, caught up in a booth.
All of sudden one nine hollars, 
"Hey all you decimals, point to your right."
Which is left to us.
I'm scratching my imagination. Poof.
It's all one.
