Poetry, in practice, 
is action,
it is paced, then rapid, 
breathless, ecstatic,
drawing on all passions.
it is paused, braced in, breathing, and back at it.

Afterwards, it's only words.

If my poetry is what you're asking,
Speaking you words is the very last thing I will do.
That is, afterwards,
when, in reverse,
my mind, returning to you,
discovers original memory,
and reimagines the happening.
You can imagine that happening to me.
Then, I'll verse back again, fast as I can.
And say, Here, you can have it!
And practice Poetry anew.

But, first! What must I do first,
If my Poetry is what you ask?
I cannot say yet!
We have to get on with the act.
