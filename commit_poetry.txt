Poetry, in practice, 
is action,
it starts rapidly, 
advancing breathless, 
drawing on all passions.
it is paced, placid, and breathing, 
then paused to imbibe the vantage,
and now then back at it.
Repaeating like that until releases ecstatic.

Afterwards, it's only words.

If my poetry is what you're asking,
Speaking you words is the very last thing I will do.
That is, afterwards,
when, in reverse,
my mind, dimensionless in view,
discovers an original memory,
and tries to imagines The Happening.
your senssation returns from my center to to my sinews
Afferance backwards.
You can imagine that happening to me.
Then, I'll verse back again, fast as I can.
And say, Here, you can have it!

While you read it, I'll be waggling.

But, first! What must I do first,
If me poetry is what you ask?
I can't say!
But you've inspired me to practice.
